- Run `php artisan migrate` to create the database structure.
- Run `php artisan cms:user:create` to create an admin user.
- Run `php artisan cms:theme:activate wowy`.

4. **If You've Pulled Source Code from a GIT Server:**

- Run `php artisan cms:publish:assets`.

5. **Run Locally:**

- Change `APP_URL` in `.env` to `APP_URL=http://localhost:8000`.
- Run `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000` to see the homepage.
- Access the admin panel by going to `/admin`.
- For sample data, the default admin account is `botble` with the password `159357`.
- If you're not using sample data, you need to go to **Admin** -> **Plugins** and activate all plugins.

## Configuring for Sub-Folders

::: warning
Since Wowy is based on the Laravel framework, its root folder is `/public`. If you're installing it in a sub-folder,
you'll need to access `your-domain.com/sub-folder/public`. To remove `/public` from the URL, follow the steps in
the [provided video tutorial](https://youtu.be/XdAYETd04iA).

## Setting Up Cron Jobs

A cron job is used to automatically send abandoned cart emails every week. You can skip this step if this feature isn't
needed.

```bash
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

For setting up a cron job in cPanel, watch this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/t5mjWGegE-g).

>  {warning} On this project, we're using the latest Laravel version (currently 8.x). Please go to [Laravel documentation page](https://laravel.com/docs) for more information.

> It’s based on Laravel framework, the root folder for it is /public. You shouldn’t install it on a sub-folder, use sub-domain is better than sub-folder. (we won’t support to install our product on sub-folder).

## Install on hosting

> {warning} If you're a Laravel developer and you want to customize our source code in `platform/core` and `platform/packages`, you need to delete folder `/vendor` then run command `composer install` to reinstall vendor packages.

- Upload all files into the root folder of your hosting (normally, it is`public_html`).
- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).

- Open file `.env` and update your database credentials (if `.env` file is not existing, you can create it from `.env.example`).
- Make sure `APP_URL` in `.env` is correct your domain. It should be `APP_URL=http://your-domain.com`
- Go to `/admin` to access to admin panel.
- The default admin account is `botble` - `159357`.
